 * __kernel_rem_pio2(x,y,e0,nx,prec)
 * double x[],y[]; int e0,nx,prec;
 * 
 * __kernel_rem_pio2 return the last three digits of N with 
 *		y = x - N*pi/2
 * so that |y| < pi/2.
 *
 * The method is to compute the integer (mod 8) and fraction parts of 
 * (2/pi)*x without doing the full multiplication. In general we
 * skip the part of the product that are known to be a huge integer (
 * more accurately, = 0 mod 8 ). Thus the number of operations are
 * independent of the exponent of the input.
 *
 * (2/pi) is represented by an array of 24-bit integers in ipio2[].
 *
 * Input parameters:
 * 	x[]	The input value (must be positive) is broken into nx 
 *		pieces of 24-bit integers in double precision format.
 *		x[i] will be the i-th 24 bit of x. The scaled exponent 
 *		of x[0] is given in input parameter e0 (i.e., x[0]*2^e0 
 *		match x's up to 24 bits.
 *
 *		Example of breaking a double positive z into x[0]+x[1]+x[2]:
 *			e0 = ilogb(z)-23
 *			z  = scalbn(z,-e0)
 *		for i = 0,1,2
 *			x[i] = floor(z)
 *			z    = (z-x[i])*2**24
 *
 *
 *	y[]	ouput result in an array of double precision numbers.
 *		The dimension of y[] is:
 *			24-bit  precision	1
 *			53-bit  precision	2
 *			64-bit  precision	2
 *			113-bit precision	3
 *		The actual value is the sum of them. Thus for 113-bit
 *		precison, one may have to do something like:
 *
 *		long double t,w,r_head, r_tail;
 *		t = (long double)y[2] + (long double)y[1];
 *		w = (long double)y[0];
 *		r_head = t+w;
 *		r_tail = w - (r_head - t);
 *
 *	e0	The exponent of x[0]. Must be <= 16360 or you need to
 *              expand the ipio2 table.
 *
 *	nx	dimension of x[]
 *
 *  	prec	an integer indicating the precision:
 *			0	24  bits (single)
 *			1	53  bits (double)
 *			2	64  bits (extended)
 *			3	113 bits (quad)
 *
 * External function:
 *	double scalbn(), floor();
 *
 *
 * Here is the description of some local variables:
 *
 * 	jk	jk+1 is the initial number of terms of ipio2[] needed
 *		in the computation. The minimum and recommended value
 *		for jk is 3,4,4,6 for single, double, extended, and quad.
 *		jk+1 must be 2 larger than you might expect so that our
 *		recomputation test works. (Up to 24 bits in the integer
 *		part (the 24 bits of it that we compute) and 23 bits in
 *		the fraction part may be lost to cancelation before we
 *		recompute.)
 *
 * 	jz	local integer variable indicating the number of 
 *		terms of ipio2[] used. 
 *
 *	jx	nx - 1
 *
 *	jv	index for pointing to the suitable ipio2[] for the
 *		computation. In general, we want
 *			( 2^e0*x[0] * ipio2[jv-1]*2^(-24jv) )/8
 *		is an integer. Thus
 *			e0-3-24*jv >= 0 or (e0-3)/24 >= jv
 *		Hence jv = max(0,(e0-3)/24).
 *
 *	jp	jp+1 is the number of terms in PIo2[] needed, jp = jk.
 *
 * 	q[]	double array with integral value, representing the
 *		24-bits chunk of the product of x and 2/pi.
 *
 *	q0	the corresponding exponent of q[0]. Note that the
 *		exponent for q[i] would be q0-24*i.
 *
 *	PIo2[]	double precision array, obtained by cutting pi/2
 *		into 24 bits chunks. 
 *
 *	f[]	ipio2[] in floating point 
 *
 *	iq[]	integer array by breaking up q[] in 24-bits chunk.
 *
 *	fq[]	final product of x*(2/pi) in fq[0],..,fq[jk]
 *
 *	ih	integer. If >0 it indicates q[] is >= 0.5, hence
 *		it also indicates the *sign* of the result.
