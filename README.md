## Maximum Spherical Mean Value for Shadow Reduction (mSMV)

Here, an algorithm based on the maximum corollary of Greenâ€™s theorem is proposed to remove shadows in quantitative susceptibility mapping while preserving the edge of the brain. This method is referred to as maximum Spherical Mean Value, or `mSMV`.

## Installation
Clone the repository with:
`git clone https://github.com/agr78/mSMV.git`

## Function arguments
For ease of use with the [`MEDI Toolbox`](https://github.com/pascalspincemaille/MEDI_toolbox) (included in `mSMV/code/dependencies/MEDI_functions/`), the function `mSMV` accepts the following arguments: \
`in_file` Input file containing the field map after background field removal (by [`PDF`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/PDF.html), [`VSHARP`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/VSHARP_STISuite.html), [`LBV`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/LBV.html), etc.) \
`out_file` Output file containing [`mSMV`](#mSMV) filtered field map \
`radius` Prefilter radius (default 5mm) \
`maxk` Maximum number of iterations with minimum kernel radius (default 5) \
`vr` Frangi filter vessel radius, see MATLAB's [`fibermetric`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/fibermetric.html) function for further details \
`pf` Optional disabling of the prefilter step (typically used with [`SHARP`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/SHARP.html), [`RESHARP`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/RESHARP.html), [`VSHARP`](https://sepia-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/bfr/VSHARP_STISuite.html), etc.)

## Prerequisites
All necessary toolboxes are included in `mSMV/code/dependencies/`. If these toolboxes are already installed, `mSMV/code/mSMV_functions/` can be added to the MATLAB path.

## Examples
The `run_simulation.m` file can be used to generate the numerical phantom from the [`paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11476).

## Notes
The vessel mask requires an $R_2^*$ map for generation, if this variable is missing in `in_file`, this step will be skipped. \
The default phase unwrapping algorithm is [`ROMEO`](https://github.com/korbinian90/ROMEO), called from a MATLAB [`mex`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html) file compiled on Windows 10. On different operating systems, `unwrapPhase` will be used.
